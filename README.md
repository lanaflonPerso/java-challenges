The exercises are ordered roughly in order of difficulty, but it's a bit
haphazard.


## How to run tests locally?
### with Eclipse
run the selected source.

### with Maven
```shell
mvn test
```

### with gradle
```shell
# Install Gradle
$ sudo apt-get install gradle

# Go inside your project folder and:
$ gradle test
```

### two ways
In this challenge, you have two ways for write your TDD
* clone all repo and make a Maven project with Junit4 (or Junit5)
* copy the class and his test in this project
